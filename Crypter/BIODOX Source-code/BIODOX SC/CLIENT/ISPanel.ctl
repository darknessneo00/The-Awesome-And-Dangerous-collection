'Name: prjPanelTest
'Description: this control is very useful for
' thse who need more space on theri forms,
' you can extend you form space using this
' control, see example form
'how to use:
' 1.- Insert a ISPanel Control in your form
' 2.- Insert controls in a  picture Box
' 3.- In the Form Load Event call the Attatch Function
' 4.- In the Query Unload event call the detatch Function
' Notes:
'   the Control Captures the events of the Picturebox,
'        so if you resize the picturebox, the control adjust the scrollbars.
'   Also, if you resize the ISPanel control, it adjust his properties
'
'   Feedback is GREATLY appreciated... Votes Would be nice ;)
